Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library and a vibrant community. “Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.
 Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”
Many developers prefer Python for its simplicity and ease of learning. Python is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. The language continues to grow in popularity due to its versatility and extensive ecosystem of packages. That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it.
 “Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy.
In recent years, Python has become a favorite choice for beginners and professionals alike. Its syntax is clear and concise, making it easier to write and maintain code. Python's large collection of third-party libraries allows developers to build applications quickly, ranging from small scripts to large-scale software projects. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.
