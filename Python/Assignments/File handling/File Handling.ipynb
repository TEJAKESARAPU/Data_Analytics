      "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library and a vibrant community. “Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.\n",

The language continues to grow in popularity due to its versatility and extensive ecosystem of packages.
